All of our test cases involve two variables: the length of the array to be searched, and the size of subarrays that processes and threads will search.
Tests 1-8:
The subarray size is kept at a constant size of 250.
The array size starts at 250 and is doubled each time until it is the size 20000.
These test cases serve to demonstrate the effect of array length on the runtimes of processes and threads.

Tests 9-13
The array size is kept at a constant size of 2000.
The sub array size starts at 16, as not to go above the recommended limit of processes, and is doubled with each test until it reaches 250.
These test cases serve to demonstrate the effect of subarray length on the runtimes of processes and threads.
